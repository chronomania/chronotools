Tools aiding in
<a href=\"http://bisqwit.iki.fi/ctfin/\">Bisqwit's Finnish Chrono Trigger translation</a>.
<p>
Meant to be useful for anyone who wants to become
a translator for Chrono Trigger and translate the
game to their own language.

", 'how:1. How to begin?' => "

So here's what you do if you want to translate Chrono Trigger.

<ul>
 <li><a href=\"#download\">Download</a> Chronotools. (Source code on this site. Windows binaries available upon request.)</li>
 <li>You need the Chrono Trigger English ROM. (You won't get it from me.)</li>
 <li>You dump the script and images from the ROM using
     <a href=\"#ctdump\">ctdump</a>, included in Chronotools.</li>
 <li>You redesign the font using an image manipulation
     program such as <a href=\"http://www.gimp.org\">GIMP</a>,
     editing <code>ct16fn.tga</code> and <code>ct8fn.tga</code>,
     and update the configuration to match the new character set
     in your font and script files.</li>
 <li>You translate the script, once in a while testing it
     by creating patches with <a href=\"#ctinsert\">ctinsert</a>.</li>
 <li>You ask me how to do this and that what you don't know. :)<br>
     For example, what to do if ctinsert reports errors,
     or if you want features like
     <a href=\"#conj\">name conjugation</a> or
     <a href=\"#vwf8\">variable width 8pix font</a>.</li>
</ul>

Feel free to <a href=\"#copying\">contact me</a> in questions
you might have about translating/hacking Chrono Trigger.<br>

Reinserts the (edited) script and (edited) fonts to a ROM.<br>
Requires the files referenced by <code>ct.cfg</code>
(usually <code>ct.txt</code>, <code>ct8fn.tga</code> and <code>ct16fn.tga</code>
and optional extra fonts and code files).<br>
Produces <code>ctpatch-hdr.ips</code>
and <code>ctpatch-nohdr.ips</code>.<br>
Curiously, it doesn't require the ROM.

", '1.1. other' => "

", '1.1.1. makeips' => "

<a href=\"/src/makeips.cc\">makeips</a>
compares two ROMs and produces a patch file in IPS format.

", '1.1.1. unmakeips' => "

<a href=\"/src/unmakeips.cc\">unmakeips</a>
reads a ROM and an IPS file and produces a patched ROM file.

", '1.1.1. xray' => "

xray is a libggi-requiring application
for browsing the ROM contents.

", '1.1.1. viewer' => "

viewer requires S-Lang and is a textmode ROM browser
originally developed by me for Pokémon hacking.

", '1.1.1. spacefind' => "

A <a href=\"/source/jaa3.html\">bin-packing</a> algorithm test.

", '1.1.1. taipus.rb' => "

This one is <a href=\"/ctfin/taipus.rb\">publicly available</a>.
It conjugates names in Finnish.<br>It has now been
<a href=\"/ctfin/ct-code.txt\">translated</a> to
SNES assembly (or sort of).<br>It works. :)

", '1.1.1. sramdump' => "

Views a sram dump file in a readable format.

", '1.1.1. base62' => "

Converts addresses between hex and base62 formats.
I.e. \$C2:5D4C -> 0eJI and vice versa.<br>
This development system uses base62 in the script
dumps to reduce the amount of code written.

", 'conj:1.1. Name conjugation' => "

<a href=\"/ctfin/ct-code.txt\">
<img src=\"/ctfin/dev/ct-taipus2.png\" alt=\"It works!\" align=right>
</a>  
It currently has support for conjugating names on fly.<br>
It's very important in Finnish, where you can't just
add \"'s\" to anything to make a genitive.<br>
For example, genitive of name Matti is \"Matin\",
and genitive of name Crono is \"Cronon\".<br>
The conjugator-engine is a textual script file
translated to 65c816 assembly on demand. It can
be customized to do conjugation in any language,
not just Finnish.
<br clear=all>

", 'skew:1.1. Font/dictionary skew' => "

It's quite complicated to explain, but shortly said:
<p>
In normal Chrono Trigger, the character set is as follows:
<ul>
 <li>127 of them are assigned to the dictionary used to compress the script.</li>
 <li><b>96</b> of them are possible
     <a href=\"/src/chronotools-16en.png\">visible symbols</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In Chronotools,
<ul>
 <li>Dictionary size may be anything between 0-223</li>
 <li>The amount of different characters the script
     may use is <b>735</b> minus dictionary size.</li>
 <li>Though, 8pix strings (items, techs, monsters, character names and so on)
     can only use about 128 different characters.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are drawbacks though.
<ul>
 <li>Shrinking the dictionary gives more available characters,
     but makes compression worse. This could cause the script
     not fit in the ROM.</li>
 <li>Extracharacters (anything above 223 minus dictionary size)
     require twice the space of normal characters. This has
     similar effect as above.</li>
</ul>

Despite these hazards this system might be a lifesaver
for someone doing an Estonian, Portuguese or even Thai translation.
<p>
Note: The Japanese version of the game is almost exactly the same
as the English version. Both have the same engine with only minor
changes. If you are going to translate to Chinese or something else
that uses thousands of different symbols, you are either going to
have to manage with ~700 symbols or have to request some changes
to the insertor.<br>

", 'wrap:1.1. Automatic paragraph wrapping' => "

<img src=\"/src/chronotools-wrapdemo.png\" alt=\"It works!\" align=right>
The program takes automatically care of proper line
lengths, so you don't have to risk running into unexpected
too-long-lines or making too short lines in paranoia.<br>
You can force line breaks (like in HTML), but you don't have to.
<p>
The image on the right shows this script piece:
<pre class=smallerpre
>Tämä on Leenen Aukio. Sanotaan, että jos
joskus kuulee Leenen Kellon soivan, elää
mielenkiintoisen ja onnellisen elämän!
</pre>
And is equal to if I had wrote this:
<pre class=smallerpre
>Tämä on Leenen Aukio. Sanotaan, että[nl]
jos joskus kuulee Leenen Kellon soivan,[nl]
elää mielenkiintoisen ja onnellisen[nl]
elämän!</pre>

<br clear=all>

", 'vwf8:1.1. Variable width 8pix font' => "

<img src=\"/src/chronotools-vwf8.png\" alt=\"It works!\" align=right>
Item, monster and technique names in Chrono Trigger are limited to 10 characters
(restriction is enforced by both the screen layout and the ROM space).<br>
This is way too little for Finnish, which has long words.
<p>
For this reason Chronotools creates a vwf8 engine that allows
the game to draw the names in thinner font that fits on the screen.
<p>
It still has the length limitation in the ROM though,
but this will be fixed eventually.

<br clear=all>

", '1.1. Very configurable' => "

I have tried to put almost everything in text-only config files
instead of hardcoding it in the programs. You won't be depending
on me to do little updates for your purposes.

", 'req:1. Requirements' => "

For source code (if you're a developer):
<blockquote>
A POSIX compatible system (like Linux or FreeBSD)
with GNU tools (GNU make, GCC etc) is required.<br>
These programs are archived as C++ source code.<br>
</blockquote>

For binaries (if you're an unfortunate user stuck with some \"Windows\"):
<blockquote>
I don't have a microsoft-operating system here on my hand,
but I have mingw32, which appears to produce working <em>commandline</em>
billware binaries. They should work in Windows 2000, Windows 98 and
possibly most other Windows systems as well.<br>
I don't offer binaries for any other platforms.<br>
If you fear the text mode and command line, you better
change your attitude and start learning :)
